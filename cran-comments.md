## Notes

> This cannot work: The whole package must be licensed as is with a single 
license. You have to choose a license that is compatible with the 
licenses of each part and if required, get permission to relicense from 
the corresponding copyright holders of the diverse parts.
If this is still MIT in the end, then only ship the CRAN template for 
the MIT license as file LICENSE.
Please fix and resubmit.
